            <p>

            <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Service Availability</h2>
            <p>
              While we strive to maintain 99.9% uptime, we cannot guarantee uninterrupted service availability.
              Scheduled maintenance will be announced in advance when possible through our official communication
              channels.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case of service disruptions, we will work to restore functionality as quickly as possible and
              communicate updates through our official channels. We are not liable for any losses or damages resulting
              from service interruptions beyond our reasonable control.
            </p>
            <p>
              Emergency maintenance may be performed without prior notice if necessary to maintain system security or
              prevent data loss. We will make every effort to minimize the impact of such maintenance on our users.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Transaction Limits and Security</h2>
            <p>
              To ensure security and comply with financial regulations, we may impose transaction limits on payments
              processed through our system. These limits may vary based on your account status, transaction history, and
              applicable laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              We employ various security measures including fraud detection systems, transaction monitoring, and
              identity verification procedures. Suspicious transactions may be flagged for manual review, which could
              result in processing delays.
            </p>

              damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our total liability to you for all claims arising from or relating to these terms or your use of our
